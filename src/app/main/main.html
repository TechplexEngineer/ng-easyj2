			<h2>"Command based programming"?</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
				WPILib supports a method of writing programs called "Command based programming". Command based programming is a design pattern to help you organize your robot programs. Some of the characteristics of robot programs that might be different from other desktop programs are:
				<ul>
				<li>Activities happen over time, for example a sequence of steps to shoot a Frisbee or raise an elevator and place a tube on a goal.</li>
				<li>These activities occur concurrently, that is it might be desirable for an elevator, wrist and gripper to all be moving into a pickup position at the same time to increase robot performance.</li>
				<li>It is desirable to test the robot mechanisms and activities each individually to help debug your robot.</li>
				<li>Often the program needs to be augmented with additional autonomous programs at the last minute, perhaps at competitions, so easily extendable code is important.</li>
				</ul>
				Command based programming supports all these goals easily to make the robot program much simpler than using some less structured technique.
